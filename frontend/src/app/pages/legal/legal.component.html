      <h3>2. Overview of Data Processing</h3>

        <li>Communication with users</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We do not sell personal data.</p>

      <h3>3. Categories of Data Processed</h3>
      <h4>3.1 Account and Profile Data</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Email address</li>
        <li>Display name</li>
        <li>Encrypted password</li>
        <li>Optional avatar image</li>

        <li>Gameplay results and rankings</li>
        <li>Group membership information</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>3.3 Technical and Security Data</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Authentication logs</li>
        <li>Session/authentication tokens</li>
        <li>Temporary IP address for security purposes</li>
        <li>Rate-limiting and abuse prevention logs</li>

        <li>Message content</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>3.5 Data Received from Third Parties</h4>
      <p>
        If a group administrator invites a person by email, that email address may be processed
        before an account is created in order to deliver the invitation.
      </p>

      <h3>4. Purpose and Legal Basis for Processing</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR - performance of the service contract</li>
        <li>
          Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR - legitimate interests (security, abuse prevention, invitation
          workflows)
        </li>
        <li>Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR - consent (where applicable)</li>
        <li>Art. 6(1)(c) GDPR - compliance with legal obligations (where applicable)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>5. Hosting, Processors, and International Transfers</h3>
      <p>The service is primarily hosted on servers located within the European Union.</p>
      <p>We use selected service providers (processors), including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Infrastructure/hosting providers (service operation and storage)</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Resend</strong> for transactional email delivery (verification, password reset,
          invitations)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Because Resend is not an EU-only provider, personal data may be processed outside the
        EU/EEA. For such transfers, we rely on an appropriate transfer mechanism under Art. 44 et
        seq. GDPR (for example, Standard Contractual Clauses and/or equivalent safeguards where
        applicable).
      </p>
      <p>
        The specific transfer mechanism and provider documentation used for production email
        operations will be finalized and documented during deployment hardening.
      </p>

      <h3>6. Data Retention</h3>
      <p>We retain personal data only as long as necessary for the stated purposes.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Account/profile data: until account deletion (unless legal obligations apply)</li>
        <li>
          Email verification tokens: max 24 hours validity; expired tokens may be replaced on
          request for unverified accounts
        </li>
        <li>Password reset tokens: max 15 minutes validity, then invalidated/removed</li>
        <li>Invite/application records: until resolved, canceled, or no longer needed</li>
        <li>
          Gameplay/group records: while group context exists; personal references are removed or
          anonymized where implemented on account deletion flows
        </li>
        <li>
          Security/rate-limit logs: short-term retention (typically up to 30 days), unless longer
          retention is required for abuse/legal handling
        </li>
        <li>Support/contact communication: as long as required for request handling</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>7. Account Deletion</h3>
      <p>
        Users may delete their account at any time. Upon deletion, profile data is removed, group
        memberships are terminated, and identifying information is deleted or anonymized where
        required by system design.
      </p>

      <h3>8. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h3>
      <p>We do not sell or rent personal data.</p>
      <p>Data may be shared only:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>When required by law</li>
        <li>To enforce legal claims</li>
        <li>To protect service security and integrity</li>
        <li>With processors acting on our behalf under contractual safeguards</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>9. Cookies, Tracking, and Local Browser Storage</h3>
      <p>
        The service uses essential technical mechanisms required for authentication and secure
        operation.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>localStorage</code> for authentication/session-related app state</li>
        <li>
          <code>sessionStorage</code> for short-lived in-app draft state (for example temporary
          game-record drafts)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>We currently do not use advertising cookies or third-party analytics tracking.</p>

      <h3>10. Data Security</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Encrypted connections (HTTPS)</li>
        <li>Secure authentication workflows</li>
        <li>Rate limiting and abuse prevention</li>
        <li>Server-side validation and upload restrictions</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>11. Your Rights Under GDPR</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Access, rectification, erasure, restriction, portability, objection</li>

        The service may allow optional external references (for example deck links). We are not
        responsible for privacy practices of external websites.
      </p>

      <p>
        MTG Pod-Manager is a web application for organizing Magic: The Gathering play groups,
        including group management, deck management, game recording, seasonal rankings/statistics,
        and invitations.
      </p>
      <p>
        The service includes publicly accessible pages (for example home, legal, and contact
        pages). These public pages may be crawled and indexed by search engines. Authenticated app
        areas (for example group management and admin areas) are intended to be non-indexable.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Registration and User Account</h3>
      <p>
        Some features require an account. Users must provide truthful information, provide a valid
        email address, and keep credentials secure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Email verification links are time-limited for security reasons. If a verification link
        expires before use, unverified users may request a new verification email after expiry.
      </p>
      <p>
        The operator may suspend or delete accounts in cases of false information, misuse, or
        violations of these Terms.
      </p>

      <h3>4. User Profiles and Content</h3>
      <p>
        Users may provide profile information and deck/group-related content. Uploaded content must
        not infringe third-party rights and must not be unlawful or abusive.
      </p>

      <h3>5. Groups and Roles</h3>
      <p>
        Group administrators may manage members, assign roles, send invitations, and define group
        rules.
      </p>

      <h3>6. Deck, Game, and Ranking Data</h3>
      <p>
        The service records deck data, match results, rankings, and statistics in group context.
        The operator does not guarantee completeness or correctness of user-entered data.
      </p>

      <h3>7. Invitations and Group Membership</h3>
      <p>
        Users may join groups by invitation, invite code, or application request. Administrators
        decide on membership approval.
      </p>

      <h3>8. Acceptable Use</h3>
      <p>Prohibited activities include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Distributing unlawful content</li>
        <li>Harassing or threatening others</li>

      </ul>

      <h3>9. Account Deletion and Termination</h3>
      <p>
        Users may delete their account at any time. On deletion, profile data is removed,
        memberships end, and roles are reassigned where necessary.
      </p>

      <h3>10. Service Availability</h3>
      <p>
        The operator aims for reliable availability but cannot guarantee uninterrupted operation.
      </p>

      <h3>11. Disclaimer of Liability</h3>
      <p>
        The service is provided \"as available\". The operator is not liable for data loss,
        incorrect rankings/statistics, user actions, group conflicts, service interruptions, or
        technical failures, except where mandatory law provides otherwise.
      </p>

      <h3>12. Donations and Voluntary Support</h3>
      <p>
        The service is free to use. Voluntary donations do not create entitlement to additional
        services.
      </p>

      <h3>13. Intellectual Property</h3>
      <p>
        The software/design/structure are protected by intellectual property law. Magic: The
        Gathering is a trademark of Wizards of the Coast LLC. This service is not affiliated with

        If you continue to use the service after the effective date, the updated Terms are
        considered accepted.
      </p>

        account.
      </p>

      <h3>16. Governing Law</h3>

        German law applies (excluding UN sales law), while mandatory consumer protection provisions
        of the user's country of residence remain unaffected.
